Corrected Analysis: Understanding the Real Discrepancy

print("=== CORRECTED ANALYSIS ===")
print("\nI was wrong about the 7.5x formula mismatch!")

print("\n1. WHAT EACH MODEL ACTUALLY REPORTS:")
print("\nGlobal Model Results (from Monte Carlo):")
print("  - Walking: 3.6 km")
print("  - Cycling: 11.8 km")
print("  - These are 'max distance walking/cycling' = velocity × time / 2")
print("  - Meaning: One-way distance to water source")

print("\nSensitivity Analysis Result:")
print("  - ~13.5 km 'water_ration_kms'")
print("  - Formula: (velocity × load) / water_ration × time")
print("  - Meaning: ??? (needs clarification)")

print("\n2. CHECKING THE UNITS:")
velocity = 3.0  # m/s
load = 20.0  # kg
water_ration = 15.0  # L
time_hours = 5.5

# Sensitivity calculation
vel_load = velocity * load  # 60 kg⋅m/s
result = vel_load / water_ration * time_hours * 3600 / 1000

print(f"\nSensitivity calculation breakdown:")
print(f"  (velocity × load) / water_ration × time")
print(f"  = ({velocity} m/s × {load} kg) / {water_ration} L × {time_hours} h × 3600 s/h / 1000")
print(f"  = {vel_load} kg⋅m/s / {water_ration} L × {time_hours * 3600 / 1000}")
print(f"  = {result:.1f}")

print(f"\nUnit analysis:")
print(f"  kg⋅m/s ÷ L × s = kg⋅m/L")
print(f"  Since 1L water ≈ 1kg, this becomes: m (meters)")
print(f"  So the result is in km, but what does it represent?")

print("\n3. POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION:")
print("The sensitivity 'water_ration_kms' might mean:")
print("- Distance you can travel per liter of daily ration")
print("- Total distance if you spread your water ration over the journey")
print("- Something else entirely?")

print("\n4. TO RESOLVE THIS:")
print("We need to:")
print("1. Calculate the SAME metric in both models")
print("2. If we want one-way distance to water:")
print("   Sensitivity should use: velocity × time / 2")
print("3. Account for slope differences properly")

# What sensitivity would give for one-way distance
one_way_dist = velocity * time_hours * 3600 / 2 / 1000
print(f"\nIf sensitivity calculated one-way distance like global:")
print(f"  Distance = {velocity} × {time_hours} × 3600 / 2 / 1000 = {one_way_dist:.1f} km")
print(f"  With slope impact (~30% reduction): {one_way_dist * 0.7:.1f} km")
print(f"  This is closer to global's 11.8 km cycling!")

print("\n5. CONCLUSION:")
print("The main issues are:")
print("- Different metrics being calculated")
print("- Different slope distributions")
print("- NOT a 7.5x formula error as I initially claimed")
