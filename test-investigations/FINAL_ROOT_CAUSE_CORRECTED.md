# üéØ FINAL ROOT CAUSE: The Time Mystery Solved

## The Problem
- **Expected**: With velocity ~1.3 m/s and time 5.5 hours ‚Üí 13 km distance
- **Actual**: Global model reports 3.71 km 
- **Mystery**: Where does the 3.6x reduction come from?

## The Investigation Results

### 1. ‚úÖ Constraints Are Fine
- `practical_limit_buckets` is working correctly
- No issues with load limits or distance caps

### 2. ‚úÖ Velocities Are Correct
- Raw velocity data shows 1.316 m/s average (reasonable)
- Matches theoretical calculations

### 3. ‚ùå Time Is The Issue
- The model is effectively using **1.57 hours** instead of **5.5 hours**
- This creates the 3.5x reduction (5.5 √∑ 1.57 = 3.5)

## Where Is The Time Being Reduced?

The investigation shows:
1. `run_global_analysis` receives `time_gathering_water=5.5`
2. This gets passed correctly to `calculate_max_distances`
3. The formula `velocity √ó time / 2` should give ~13 km
4. But the final result is 3.71 km

## Possible Explanations

### Theory 1: Hidden Time Division
There might be code that divides the time by ~3.5 somewhere in the pipeline that we haven't found yet.

### Theory 2: Different Metric
The model calculates two different metrics:
- `weighted_med`: Median of actual distances to water (`dtw_1`)
- `weighted_med_walking`: Median of maximum walking distances

But our investigation shows `weighted_med_walking` IS being reported as 3.71 km, which should be based on `max distance walking`.

### Theory 3: Data Issue
The velocity data we're looking at (1.316 m/s) might not be the same data used to generate the results files.

## Next Steps

To definitively solve this:
1. **Run a controlled test** with known inputs through the entire pipeline
2. **Add logging** at each step to trace where the time/distance gets reduced
3. **Check if results files are outdated** or from different parameter runs

## Current Status

The 3.6x discrepancy is real and appears to be caused by an effective time of 1.57 hours being used instead of 5.5 hours. The exact location where this time reduction occurs has not been found in the code review, suggesting either:
- A hidden calculation we haven't discovered
- The results files are from a different run with different parameters
- There's a data preprocessing step that modifies the velocities or distances
